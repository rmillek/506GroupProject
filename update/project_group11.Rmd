## Linear Discriminant Analysis 

### What is Linear Discriminant Analysis?

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is most commonly used as dimensionality reduction technique in the pre-processing step for pattern-classification and machine learning applications. The goal is to project a dataset onto a lower-dimensional space with good class-separability in order avoid overfitting.

### Dataset: Geometric Properties of Wheat Seeds

For our data analysis, we will be using the "Seeds" dataset, found on [UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds#). This dataset is comprised observations of kernels from 3 different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa and Canadian. Each group has randomly selected 70 observations, for a total of 210 observations. Aside from the grouping variable, there are 7 geometrical measurments given to each observation:

1. area = Area
2. peri - Perimeter
3. comp = Compactness (C = 4\*pi\*A/P^2)
4. l = Length of kernel
5. w = Width of kernel
6. Asym = Asymmetry coefficient
7. lgroove = Length of kernel groove
  

We will be using each qualitative attribute to classify each group, and once a fit model has been obtained, make predicted classifications of other kernels with certain attributes.  

For this analysis, we present three tutorials, each using a different statisitcal software. The languages presented here are R, STATA, and SAS. Please note that, due to inconsistencies in random number generators across languages, the results might be slightly different in each tutorial, but the core task shown in each program is the same.

### R

There are a few key libraries to install and load for our analysis. To perform Linear Discriminant Analysis in R we will make use of the `lda` function
in the package `MASS`. We will also use `ggplot2` and `car` for graphing purposes.

```{r libraries, echo=TRUE}
library(MASS)
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
```

#### Description of Data

After reading in our dataset and grouping our catagorical variable, we can view the summaries of our variables of interest using the `summary` function.

```{r summary, echo=TRUE}
seeds = read.csv("./seeds.csv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
seeds$group = as.factor(seeds$group)
levels(seeds$group) = c("Kama", "Rosa", "Canadian")
summary(seeds)
scatterplotMatrix(seeds[1:7])
```

We notice through the scatterplot matrix that some variables are collinear with each other, especially the variables `area` and `peri` with `l` and `w`. This makes sense intuitively, as we use length and width to find the area and perimeter. Normally this would be a problem, but as our goal is to use all given data for classification purposes only, then as long as we achieve high accuracy on our testing procedure, we can ignore this issue.

The purpose of LDA in this example is to find the linear combinations of the original variables that gives the best possible separation to easily distinguish the groups in our data set. In finding how many conbinations are needed to best differentiate our classifications, we take the number of groups and variables into account. The number of groups is $G=3$, and the number of variables is $v=7$. The greatest amouont of useful discriminant functions that can separate the wheat types by geometric properties is the lesser of $G-1$ and $v$. In this case it is the lesser of 2 and 7, so we should find 2 useful discriminant functions to classify our wheat types.

#### Train/Test Sequence

In order to use LDA, we need to first split the data into a part used to train the classifier, and another part that will be used to test the classifier. For this example we will try an 70:30 split

```{r set_train, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(123) 
seedss = sample.int(n = nrow(seeds), size = floor(.7*nrow(seeds)), replace = F)
train = seeds[seedss, ]
test  = seeds[-seedss, ]
```

We are then able to train our classifier in the following way:

```{r train, echo=TRUE}
lseeds = lda(group~., train)
lseeds
```

This means that the first discriminant function is a linear combination of the variables: $$0.166*Area+3.300*Perimeter+...+3.144*Groove$$.
and the second is : $$4.623*Area-9.244*Perimeter+...+6.846*Groove$$

Now with our train data model, we can predict our classifications with our test data:

```{r test, echo=TRUE}
lseeds.values = predict(lseeds, test[,1:7])
```

This function will attempt to classify each of these observations, based solely on their quantitative attributes.

```{r plot, echo=TRUE}
plot.data = data.frame(LD1=lseeds.values$x[,1], LD2=lseeds.values$x[,2], WheatType=test$group)
head(plot.data)                       
p <- ggplot(data=plot.data, aes(x=LD1, y=LD2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=WheatType)) +
  theme_bw()
p
```

We can easily see the separation of wheat types from the scatterplot. The first discriminant function (x-axis) separates Rosa from the other types very well, but does not perfectly separate Kama and Canadian. The second discriminant function (y-axis) shows a good separation of Kama and Canadian, a fair separation of Rosa and Kama, and very little separation of Rosa and Canadian. To achieve the best separation of the three types, we should use both the first and second discriminant functions together.

Now we can check the error rate of our classification test:

```{r errors, echo=TRUE}
error_tab = table(test$group,lseeds.values$class)
```

```{r error_tab, echo=FALSE}
cap = "**Table 1** Classifications of test group. Each row represents the test group, and each column shows how they were classified in the model."
knitr::kable(error_tab, align='c', caption = cap)
```

As we see from the table, only 1 of the 63 observations in our test data was incorrectly classified (The one 'Kama' that was classified as 'Canadian'). This gives us a predicted error rate of 1.59%, very low considering. This gives us more reason to believe LDA makes good use in our classification.

### STATA

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(Statamarkdown)
stataexe <- "C:/VApps/Stata_SE/15/StataSE-64.exe"
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine = 'stata', engine.path=stataexe, comment = '')
```
  
#### Description of Data

Now, we perform our analysis using STATA. First, we read in the Seeds data set and obtain some summary statistics to get an intial understanding of the data with which we will be working: 
```{stata first-Stata, echo=TRUE,  engine.path=stataexe, collectcode = T}
// import the seeds data from local directory, relabel, and summarize
import delimited seeds.csv
summarize area peri comp l w asym lgroove
```
  
Next, we create a matrix of graphs or correlations between the potential explanatory variables to gain an initial understanding of how they are related:  
  
```{stata second-Stata, engine.path=stataexe, echo=2, results = "hide"}
// graph correlations between the variables of interest
graph matrix area peri comp l w asym lgroove
graph export graph1.png, replace
```
  
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("graph1.png")
```
  
We see some strong correlations in the predictors, as there are several pairs of explanatory variables that have a reasonbly strong, approximately linear correlation.  
We should note that the purpose of the linear disciminant analysis (LDA) in this example is primarily classification. We are hoping to find linear combinations of the 7 potential predictors in the data set that yield the best possible separation among seeds based on their wheat variety. In other words, we want the best separation such that each group of seeds can be identified based on their other characteristics.

Note that we want to separate the seeds by their wheat variety. There are three possible wheat varieties, so the number of groups here is *G* = 3, and the number of possible predictors is *p* = 7. We have that the maximum number of useful discriminant functions that can separate the seeds by wheat variety is the minimum of *G - 1* and *p*, which in this cases would be *G - 1* or 2. Hence, we can find at most two useful discriminant functions to classify the seeds by wheat variety.

#### Train/Test Sequence

To perform an LDA analysis, it is necessary to split the data into a training set and a test set such that the performance of the LDA functions can be measured. To do this, we select random entries from the data set such that 70% of the data can be used for training and the remaining 30% can be used for testing:  

```{stata third-Stata, engine.path=stataexe, echo=TRUE, results = "hide"}
// separate into training and test set
set seed 123
generate random = runiform()
sort random
generate trainsamp = _n <= 147

// save test set for later
preserve
keep if !trainsamp
save test.dta, replace
restore

// keep training 
keep if trainsamp
```

We then use the training set to perform our LDA analysis:  
  
```{stata fourth-Stata, engine.path=stataexe, echo=TRUE}
// perform LDA analysis
candisc area peri comp l w asym lgroove, group(group)
```
  
For our example, there are two discriminant dimensions. The F-ratio tests in the table labeled "Canonical linear discrimnant analysis" are both significant, which indicates that both dimensions are needed to describe the differences between the seeds.  

The next table, labeled "Standardized canonical discriminant function coefficients" gives us our two discriminant functions, estimated from the training data, which would then be:
$$-0.494*Area+1.997*Perimeter...+.721*Groove$$
and:
$$4.888*Area+-4.471*Perimeter...+1.598*Groove$$
  
The remaining output yields means and classification percentages (i.e. the proportion classified correctly) for the training data.  

Now, to visualize the separation, we have:

```{stata fifth-Stata, engine.path=stataexe, echo=-c(1,7), results = "hide"}
quietly candisc area peri comp l w asym lgroove, group(group)
// change labels for future plotting
label define lab2 1 K 2 R 3 C 
label values group lab2
// generate plot to show the separation
scoreplot, msymbol(i)
graph export graph2.png, replace
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("graph2.png")
```
  
We see that the first discriminant function appears to separate Rosa seeds from the other types well, though it does not seems to separate Canadian and Kama seeds very much.  
The second discriminant funciton appears to separate the Kama seeds fairly well from the others, but Rosa and Canadian seeds are not well-seperated. The plot suggests that both discriminant functions are necessary here to differentiate between the seed types.  

Finally, we apply our estimated functions from the training data to the test data to get an idea of the prediction error that comes from this LDA model:  

```{stata sixth-Stata, engine.path=stataexe,  echo = c(2,3,4,5,6,7), echo=TRUE}
quietly candisc area peri comp l w asym lgroove, group(group)
// calculate prediction error by finding incorrect predictions for test set
use test.dta, clear
predict outcome, classification
label values outcome labseed
count if outcome != group
```
  
We see that of the 63 observations in the test set, only 3 were incorrectly predicted by our trained LDA model. As such, the prediction error here is only 4.76%. Hence, the LDA approach appears to work well for this data, which is supported not only by the low prediction error, but also by the plot, which shows fairly clear separation for the seed varieties.

### SAS

#### Import data to SAS

```{}
/* file name */
filename seeds '~/stat506/project/seeds_dataset.txt';

/* import data */
data seeds_original;
	infile seeds delimiter = '	' MISSOVER;
	input area peri comp l w asym igroove group;
run;
```

$~$

#### Train/Test

- Using "train and test split" with ratio 7:3 to create training and testing datasets:

```{}
/* train and test split by group */
proc surveyselect data=seeds_original rate=.3 outall out=seeds_select;
	strata group;
run;

/* training set*/
data seeds_train;
	set seeds_select;
	where Selected = 0;
	drop Selected SelectionProb SamplingWeight;
run;

/* testing set*/
data seeds_test;
	set seeds_select;
	where Selected = 1;
	drop Selected SelectionProb SamplingWeight;
run;
```

$~$

#### Summary of training dataset

```{}
/* summary of training dataset*/
proc means data=seeds_train n mean std min max;
  var area peri comp l w asym igroove;
run;
```


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("train_sum.png")
```

There are 147 observations in the training dataset.

$~$

#### Summary of training dataset by group

```{}
/* summary of training dataset by group*/
proc means data=seeds_train n mean std;
  class group;
  var area peri comp l w asym igroove;
run;
```

Group 1 is Kama; Group 2 is Rose; Group 3 is Canadian. The table below shows the mean of each predictors by different groups. Several variables have clear differences of means for different groups.


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("train_sum_group.png")
```

$~$

#### Correlation between predictors

```{}
/* correlation */
proc corr data=seeds_train;
  var area peri comp l w asym igroove;
run;
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("cor.png")
```

$~$

#### Discriminant Analysis (using "discrim" function)

```{}
/* analysis */
proc discrim data=seeds_train testdata=seeds_test testout=fake_out out=discrim_out can;
  class group;
  var area peri comp l w asym igroove;
run;
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("a_1.png")
```

There are three groups which indicates that the number of discriminant dimensions is 3-1 which is 2. The two discriminant dimensions are both statistically significant based on the table above (P values of the F-tests are very small). As a result, both dimensions are very useful to describe the differences between the groups of seeds. The canonical correlations for the two dimensions are 0.93 and 0.87.


$~$

The four tables below provide us more details of the model that we get based on the training dataset. We can know the discriminat coefficients (raw and standardized) and class means of each demension.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("a_7.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '30%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("a_8.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '30%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("a_9.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '35%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("a_10.png")
```

The two discrimant functions are (based on the standardized coefficients):

$discriminant_1 = -0.301*Area + 0.379*Perimeter + ... + 0.821*Groove$

$discriminant_2 = 4.103*Area + -4.631*Perimeter + ... + 1.694*Groove$

$~$

The two tables below are the summary tables of training and tesing dataset. Based on these two tables, we can notice that the training error and testing error are both very small. The accuracy is almost 1. The model predicts the data well.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("a_5.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("a_4.png")
```

$~$

#### Plot the classification

```{}
/* plot */
data plotclass;
  merge fake_out discrim_out;
run;

proc template;
  define statgraph classify;
    begingraph;
      layout overlay;
        contourplotparm x=Can1 y=Can2 z=_into_ / contourtype=fill  
						 nhint = 30 gridded = false;
        scatterplot x=Can1 y=Can2 / group=group includemissinggroup=false
	                 	    markercharactergroup = group;
      endlayout;
    endgraph;
  end;
run;

proc sgrender data = plotclass template = classify;
run;
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("plot_da.png")
```

From the plot, we can know that two discriminant dimensions can classify groups very well. We can notice that "can1" can seperate group 2 from other two groups and "can2" can seperate group 1 and group 3 well.
