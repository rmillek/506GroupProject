Group 11: Alex Kellner, Reed Millek, Zhaobo Wu

Current working RMarkdown file is labeled "project_group11.Rmd"

Current working HTML file is labeled "project_group11.html"

Other necessary files included in main branch, some files of interest in various folders

In order to knit the RMarkdown file, it is necessary to have the package "Statamarkdown" installed, which can be done by:

library(devtools) # you may need to install devtools

install_github(hemken/Statamarkdown)

Also note that knitting the RMarkdown file currently requires that the user works on a machine with STATA installed. The path to STATA may need to be changed to run properly.

TO DO: Make file easier to knit without additional downloads, clean up mild differences between languages, add references, expand introduction and consider adding conclusion
